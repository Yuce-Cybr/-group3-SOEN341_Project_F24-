## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a peer assessment system designed for university team projects. The system will facilitate anonymous peer evaluations based on four critical criteria: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. By allowing students to assess each other, the system provides a structured platform for constructive feedback, helping to improve team collaboration and individual accountability. Instructors will oversee the process to ensure fairness and transparency, promoting responsible participation and engagement within the team.

## Problem Statement

In many university team projects, ensuring equal contribution and accountability among team members can be challenging. Without a clear mechanism for evaluating individual performance, students may fail to meet expectations, leading to frustration and an unequal distribution of work. Additionally, team members may not have the opportunity to provide feedback on their peers’ contributions in a structured, anonymous, and constructive manner.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed peer assessment system addresses these challenges by enabling students to anonymously evaluate their peers based on predefined criteria. This system will allow for transparent feedback on each member's cooperation, conceptual contributions, practical contributions, and overall work ethic, promoting better teamwork and personal accountability. Instructors will be able to monitor the assessments to ensure that feedback is fair and consistent, thus fostering an improved learning environment.
