## Project Description

This project consists of creating a peer assessment system meant to be used for university team projects. This system will allow students to anonymously evaluate their peers  on four aspects: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. This will allow students to provide and receive constructive feedback on their work and will also be monitored by the instructor. This will keep the students accountable of working on a project and encourage them to fulfill their part within the team.
