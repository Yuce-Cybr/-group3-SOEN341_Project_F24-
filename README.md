## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a peer assessment system for university team projects. The system will facilitate anonymous peer evaluations based on four critical criteria: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. By allowing students to assess each other, the system provides a structured platform for constructive feedback, helping to improve team collaboration and individual accountability. Instructors will oversee the process to ensure fairness and transparency, promoting responsible participation and engagement within the team.

## Problem Statement

Ensuring equal contribution and accountability among team members in many university team projects can be challenging. Without a clear mechanism for evaluating individual performance, students may fail to meet expectations, leading to frustration and an unequal distribution of work. Additionally, team members may not be able to provide feedback on their peers’ contributions in a structured, anonymous, and constructive manner.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed peer assessment system addresses these challenges by enabling students to anonymously evaluate their peers based on predefined criteria. This system will allow for transparent feedback on each member's cooperation, conceptual contributions, practical contributions, and overall work ethic, promoting better teamwork and personal accountability. Instructors will be able to monitor the assessments to ensure that feedback is fair and consistent, thus fostering an improved learning environment.

## Team Members and Roles 
(Throughout the project, members change role so that everyone has a chance to work on something different for the project)

- **Mridul**:
  Responsible for task breakdowns and the creation of user stories. She ensures that the project is organized and that individual tasks are clearly defined. Mridul also takes meeting minutes and tracks team progress throughout the development cycle.
  
- **Aryan**:
  Collaborates with Mridul on task breakdowns and user story development. He contributes to organizing project workflows and ensuring that each phase is completed on time. He does the sprint planning to ensure the work is done in time.

- **Paul**:
  Manages the project’s GitHub repository and oversees the ReadMe documentation, ensuring that the project’s code is properly version-controlled and that documentation is clear and up to date. He helps in sprint planning to coordinate team efforts and some user stories. He also helped with the back-end side of the code (and also sometimes resolves some front-end problems).

- **Sitherankan**:
  Works alongside Paul to manage the GitHub repository and maintain the ReadMe documentation. He assists in sprint planning and coordinates team tasks to ensure alignment with project goals. He also helped with the front-end developpement and worked on testing (and also CICD).

- **Youssef**:
  Youssef is responsible for the front-end development, ensuring that the user interface is functional, intuitive, and meets the project’s design specifications.

- **David**:
  David is in charge of the back-end development, focusing on building the system architecture, APIs, and database structure to support the peer assessment functionalities.
