## Project Description

This project aims to create a peer assessment system tailored for university team projects. The system will enable students to anonymously evaluate their peers across four key dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. Through this feedback mechanism, students will have the opportunity to provide and receive constructive evaluations on their teamwork performance. Additionally, instructors will oversee the system to ensure fair and accountable participation from all team members, fostering a collaborative and responsible work environment.
